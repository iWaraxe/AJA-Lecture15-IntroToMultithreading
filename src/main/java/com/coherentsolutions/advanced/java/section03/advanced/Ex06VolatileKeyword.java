// Summary
// --------------------
// - Synchronization is essential for ensuring thread safety when accessing shared resources.
// - The synchronized keyword and locks prevent race conditions by ensuring that only one thread can access critical sections at a time.
// - ReentrantLock offers more advanced locking mechanisms, while atomic variables provide lightweight alternatives to locking.
// - The volatile keyword ensures visibility of changes across threads, but does not provide atomicity.

// Up Next: Weâ€™ll dive into how to manage thread pools and advanced concurrency utilities!
